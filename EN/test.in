The

was
marred
by
coast-to-coast
name-calling
between

it
made
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
an

Why

Mr.

The

Earthquake
's
Damage

The
larger
parallel
after
the
earthquake
centered
south
of
San
Francisco
is
surely
with
the
state
of
the
U.S.
economy
.

Rick
Sherlund
,
a
Goldman
Sachs
analyst
,
said
Lotus
had
upgrade
revenue
of
about
$
22

in

,
twice
what
he
had
expected
.

Meanwhile

International

a

of
software
products
aimed
at
eliminating
some
of
the
major
problems
involved
in
computerizing
manufacturing
operations
,
industry
executives
said
.

By
afternoon
,
the
broader
market
joined
the
advance
in
full
strength
.

However
,
when
powerful
forces
start
shaking
the
market
's
structure
,
the
more
``
earthquake-resistant
''
it
is
,
the
better
its
chance
for
survival
.

After
prodding
from
Mr.
Sanford
,
U.S.
Attorney
Jack
Eskenazi
pleaded
with
Justice
Department
officials
in
Washington
to
let
the
indictment
proceed
.

The
post
of
chief
executive
has
been
vacant
since
July
when
Terry
Pryce
,
55
,
left
the
company
.

``
It
's
part
of
our
style
,
too
.
''

That
helped
persuade
the
company
to
introduce
a
new
advertising
slogan
:
``
A
warm
hug
from
Campbell
's
.
''

That
means
that
a
corporation
,
after
a
specified
amount
of
time
has
passed
,
can
buy
back
its
bonds
by
paying
investors
the
face
value
-LRB-
plus
,
in
some
cases
,
a
sweetener
-RRB-
.

The

caused

As
vice
president\/national-government

,
Mr.

will
work
with

and
with
the

government-relations
staff
``
to
represent
P&G
's
interests
at
the
federal
level
,
''
said
John
G.
Smale
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

But
some
money
managers
are
doing
just
that
.

Western
New
Mexico
Telephone
,
Silver
City
,
had
net
income
of
$
1.9
million
on
revenue
of
about
$
10

last
year
.

Mr.
Mastro
has
been
with
the
New
York
U.S.
attorney
's
office
for
nearly
five
years
.

Trading
also
was
heavy
in
the
over-the-counter
market
.

Some
analysts
suggest
,
however
,
that
the
ratio
has
weakened
in
value
as
an
indicator
because
options
and
other
products
can
be
used
to
hedge
short
positions
.

But
now
,
an
official
says
,
he
is
``
surrounded
by
right-to-lifers
,
''
who
contend
that
any
breakthroughs
in
fetal-tissue
research
could
increase
the
demand
for
abortions
.

bullish
views

The

more

,
allows
the
results
to
be
interpreted
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
.

The

a

The

warns
that
even
if
the

for

It

Key
to
the
issue
is
that
the

It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.

Mr.

an
innocent
victim

prosecutorial
overzealousness
.

Amoco
is
the
first
major

report

The
process
typically
begins
when
an
institution
,
such
as
Citibank

Sears
,
Roebuck

Co.
,
takes
a
pool
of
credit-card
or
other
receivables

sells
them
to
a
specially
created
trust
.

Says
Mr.
Riese
of
National

:
``
If
you
resisted
on

,
maybe
you
would
never
get
that
telephone

The
package
helps
carriers
solve
pricing
problems

such
as
how
to
react
to
discounts
offered
by
competitors
or
what
would
be
the
optimum
number
of
seats
to
offer
at
a
given
price
.

He
said
the
improvement
was
a
result
of
cost
savings
achieved
by
consolidating
manufacturing
operations
,
blending
two
sales
organizations
and
focusing
more
carefully
the
company

promotional
activities

``
To
me
it
says
that

we
have
ways
of
holding
wealth
similar
to
100

Barring
any
petroleum-related
news
events
,
trading
in
the
days
ahead

further
test
recent

watchers
that
strong
fourth-quarter
demand
will
keep

firm

New

One
variation
that
appealed

me

Third
,
the
theory
suggests
why
legislators
who
pay
too
much
attention
to
national
policy
making
relative
to
local
benefit-seeking
have
lower
security
in
office
.

In
his

the

``

odds

policies
welcoming

foreign

allocation
