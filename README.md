## Part 2
1. Place your required `train` files and `dev_in` files into the respective `EN`, `CN` and `SG` folders.

2. Run Part 2 code via `python part_2.py`

3. This generates the `dev.p2.out` files in the respective `EN`, `CN` and `SG` folders.

## Part 3
1. Place your required `train` files and `dev_in` files into the respective `EN`, `CN` and `SG` folders.

2. Run Part 3 code via `python part_3.py`

3. This generates the `dev.p3.out` files in the respective `EN`, `CN` and `SG` folders.

## Part 4
1. Place your required `train` file and `dev_in` file into the respective `EN` folder.

2. Run Part 4 code via `python part_4.py`

3. This generates the `dev.p4.out` files in the respective `EN` folder.

## Part 5
1. Place your required `train` file, `dev_in` file and `test.in` file into the respective `EN` folder.

2. Run Part 5 code: 
    - `python part_5_dev.py` for generating `dev.p5.out` in the respective `EN` folder.
    - `python part_5_test.py` for generating `test.p5.out` in the respective `EN` folder.

3. (Optional) The `EN` folder also contains the `test.p5.k8.out` output and `part_5_test_k8.py` if we set the k-value to be 8 for our second order HMM model. 
This can be generated by `python part_5_test_k8.py`
